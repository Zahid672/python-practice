"""List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
Ordered:lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If we add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list
Changeable: The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
Allow duplicates: Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:"""

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "banana", "apple", "apple" ]
print(mylist)
